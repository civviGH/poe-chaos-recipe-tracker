# Chaos recipe tracker

Very simple chaos recipe tracker written in python. Only supports two handed weapons for tracking and only
total chaos made is tracked, not regals or similar.

# Installation

Just make sure you have python >= 3.6 installed and install all packages in the requirements file.

# Start

Either use `start_windows` or run
```
cd designer
python3 chaos.pyw
```

# Usage

Num keys refer to the buttons in the GUI.
The `-` key sells a chaos recipe set for 1 chaos.
The `+` key sells it for 2.

ahk-script.ahk is an autohotkey script so the numblock keypresses make it to the window even ingame.
